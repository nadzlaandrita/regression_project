 Include Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression

Linear, Lasso, and Ridge regression are all techniques used in the field of statistics and machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. These techniques are commonly employed in regression analysis to predict or explain the behavior of a target variable based on the values of other variables. Let's explore each of these regression methods in a complete way:

Linear Regression:

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most fundamental techniques in regression analysis. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

The goal of linear regression is to find the values of the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals (differences between the predicted and actual values). Linear regression can be solved using various methods, such as the ordinary least squares (OLS) method.

Linear regression is simple to interpret and implement, but it assumes a strict linearity between the variables and may not perform well when dealing with complex, nonlinear relationships.

Lasso Regression:

Lasso stands for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator." Lasso regression is a linear regression technique with a penalty term added to the cost function. It's useful for feature selection and can help prevent overfitting.
$λ$ (lambda) is the regularization parameter that controls the amount of regularization applied. Higher values of $λ$ lead to more aggressive feature selection.
Lasso regression encourages sparsity in the model by pushing some of the coefficients to zero. This makes it particularly useful when you have a large number of features, some of which may not be relevant to the prediction. Lasso can help you automatically select the most important features while reducing overfitting.

Ridge Regression:

Ridge regression is another variation of linear regression that addresses some of the issues of multicollinearity (when independent variables are highly correlated). It adds a regularization term to the cost function.
$λ$ (lambda) is the regularization parameter, but it acts on the squares of the coefficients.
Ridge regression encourages the coefficients to be small but not exactly zero. It can help mitigate the problem of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients. Ridge is suitable when you believe that many of the features are relevant, and you want to reduce their impact without excluding them entirely.

In summary, linear regression is a basic method for modeling relationships between variables. Lasso and Ridge regressions are variations that introduce regularization to improve model performance and feature selection. Lasso encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to zero, while Ridge addresses multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients towards zero without eliminating them. The choice between these methods depends on the specific characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.
